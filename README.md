Moored buoy data collected from oceanic environments serve as critical sources
of information for weather forecasting, climate research, and oceanographic
studies. Ensuring the quality and reliability of such data is paramount to
maintaining the accuracy of subsequent analyses and predictions. This paper
presents a comprehensive approach to data quality control for moored buoy
datasets, integrating three fundamental tests: stuck value detection, longitude
validation, and spike identification. By systematically applying these tests,
erroneous or anomalous data points are identified and flagged for further
examination or correction. Additionally, a predictive model is developed to
estimate missing values within the dataset, enhancing its completeness and utility
for downstream analyses. Through the implementation of these methods, the
proposed approach offers a robust framework for enhancing the reliability and
usability of moored buoy data in oceanic research and forecasting applications
